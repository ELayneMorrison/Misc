import numpy as np

## 1. Lets get some data

#Lets get some data. In this case, we downloaded some files from the College Scorecard.
#We can use pandas (pd) to read in the csv files.
#lets read it into a datafile (df is the typical abbreviation), an object that looks and feels like an excel workbook
datafile = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/erica.morrison/Downloads/CollegeScorecard_Raw_Data/MERGED2017_18_PP.csv')

#Lets have a look at it - using df.head(), df.tail(), df.sample()
datafile.head()

This worked well, but we don't want to run one line for each file when there are 20 files - or 2000 files.
## II. Read-in Take 2!

os.chdir("C:/Users/erica.morrison/Downloads/CollegeScorecard_Raw_Data")

#Confirm directory 
#os.getcwd() 

#List all the files
os.listdir()

#We know this is a list object because of the brackets. We can also save this to an object for easier manipulation.
entries = os.listdir()

print(entries)

entries_short = entries[5:28]
#Doublecheck it 
#print(entries_short)

for x in entries_short:
    x = pd.read_csv(x)
